Programming this week was perhaps one of the more frustrating weeks. It didn’t help that I had missed the previous week’s class (Food poisoning, if you desperately wanted to know.) but I had felt like I was hitting a cognitive wall for a while. Maybe I rested on my laurels too much. The first few weeks were a breeze and folks were asking me for help and I felt sovereign. (Okay, hyperbole.) But now, I am having to tell people that I can’t help because I don’t know what I’m doing anymore.

Lab on Monday helped a lot. Watching Scott explain the code to Joe helped me immensely. Maybe, much like the paired coding helped, I needed to watch somebody else parsing things out and learning how to code something to better be able to code myself. That seems like an interesting possibility.

I also know I was relying on Scott too much to give me the answers for keyed-up ball. There was frustration all around and I felt bad for being a needy child about it. Though, I did get that damn ball to be keyed-up by the end of lab.
