This week the dailies actually intimidated me. I wasn’t sure how arrays work. Actually, I still don’t. But I found ways to work around them. I worked on the dailies a bit, and when I got frustrated, I laid down and worked on it in my mind as I fell asleep. It’s interesting how a bit of distance can give you the answer.

Though, this week, I’m not 100% sure how my sketches work. There seems to be a few bubbles formed at once, but sometimes there’s just one. They also shake a bit and I’m not 100% sure how that works. But they work, which is an odd sensation. 

I’m interested in the conditionals, like “if,” and the inputs, and how far you can take them. Can you make interactive games with these? 
Another thing I’m curious about is the ball-bounce sketch and how difficult it would be to have the balls bounce off each other. Would that require advanced math? (And by “advanced,” I mean anything beyond high school algebra, for me.
